InputValet
==========

Small (optionally jQuery compatible) javascript for validating and formatting input.

About
-----

InputValet provides a set of functions to both reformat and validate an input
using a regex and a separator. It also provides pre- and post- hooks for
altering the input / output values before and after the formatting, as well as
define a jQuery validator.

This was originally written to support the strict post code formatting required by AVS
checks for credit cards in the UK, but obviously can be used in any applicable context.
